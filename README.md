## Developing

The following instructions are geared towards developers, intending to contribute to xud-docker.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8 (or higher)

### Initial setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud-docker.git $PROJECT_DIR
```

### Developing a feature

Create a feature branch.

```
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

Make your desired changes to the images located at: `$PROJECT_DIR/images`.

Build your modified images.

```bash
tools/build
```

Test it locally.

```bash
bash setup.sh -b your-feature-branch
```

To let others test without building the images by themselves push your feature branch to remote repository. Travis will build & push images for you.

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

After the corresponding Travis build succeeded, other people can easily run your feature branch on their machine like this.

```bash
./xud.sh -b your-feature-branch
```
