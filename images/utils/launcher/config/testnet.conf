# Sample configuration file for xud-docker testnet environment

# The `expose-ports` option value is an array of strings. The element syntax
# follows Docker published port style (https://docs.docker.com/config/containers
# /container-networking/#published-ports). There are three basic formats:
# 1. <container_port> (e.g. "8080")
# 2. <host_port>:<container_port> (e.g. "80:8080")
# 3. <host_ip>:<host_port>:<container_port> (e.g. "127.0.0.1:80:8080")
